Before nVotes can allow users to cast their vote, they must authenticate themselves in the [login webpage](https://go.nvotes.com/election/13/public/login) with their Authentication Code received by email or SMS.

## Email authentication

Users will receive an email with the Authentication Code that enables them to vote. This means voters will be required to have an email account. It is recommended to send an email all the census some days before the election starts, announcing that on the date the election starts they will receive an email from [vote@nvotes.com](vote@nvotes.com).

Both the body and subject of the authentication email are configurable. You can include any text you want and you can add a link to the voting booth inserting the code `__URL__` and the Authentication Code inserting `__CODE__`

## SMS authentication

Users will receive an sms with the Authentication Code that enables them to vote. This means voters will be required to have an email account.

The SMS text is configurable, within the limits of 140 characters, and it cannot contain accents. You can include any text you want and you can add a link to the voting booth inserting the code `__URL__` and the Authentication Code inserting `__CODE__`. If you want the link included in the SMS to open the login page and automatically include the Authentication Code use `__URL__//__CODE__`
