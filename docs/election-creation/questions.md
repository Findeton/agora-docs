An election can have one or more questions (you can add as many questions as needed). The following parameters can be configured for each question:

## Title

Question title. It can include a link to a webpage ( for example: `Click <a href="http://myweb.com/page">here</a> to see the candidates`)

## Description

Question description. It can include a link to a webpage ( for example: `Click <a href="http://myweb.com/page">here</a> to see the candidates`)

## Voting systems

There are different possible tallying method:

### Plurality at large

The option with more votes wins. If there are abstentions, these are not considered in the tally.

[Wikipedia: Plurality at large](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality-at-large_voting)

### Borda

According to this methodology, candidates are ordered by the preferences of each voter; in the tally, each position in the ranking is assigned a punctuation: 1 point for the last one, 2 points for the next one, 3 for the next etc. This system takes into consideration not only the most preferred option of each voter, but also the other ones, so that sometimes it will elect broadly acceptable options instead of those preferred by a majority. Thus, this system is considered a consensus-based voting system rather than majoritarian.

[Wikipedia: Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)

### Borda Dowdall o de Nauru

This is a modification of the standard Borda. Candidates are ordered by the preference of each voter; in the tally, each position in the ranking is assigned a punctuation: 1 point for the first one, 1/2 points for the second, 1/3 for the third, etc. As in the standard Borda voting system, this system is consensus-based rather than majoritarian, in the sense that sometimes the winners will be broadly acceptable ones rather than the those preferred by a majority.

### Pairwise (beta-distribution)

This voting system is suitable for an election with multiple two-optionquestions. This tally method is experimental and shouldn't be used without contacting nVotes previously.

In the annex [Voting systems example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJoeMALMSA7wp5Kzo3zILtjbD9rSK82Yl6ALM0-xdKI/pub#h.7tuyegruxmsr) the differences between the results generated by different voting systems for a given election can be seen.

## Number of winners

How many winners can there be? The minimum is one and the maximum is the number of options.

## Minimum/Maximum number of selected options

How many options can the voter select? The minimum is zero (which allows blank votes) and the maximum is the number of options.

## Randomize options order

When this option is active, the candidate options will be displayed in a different order to each voter in the voting booth.

Try it out! Visit [this election](https://go.nvotes.com/booth/8/vote). Notice the candidate options order. Then reload the webpage, you will see the order has changed.

## Layout

You can see a [demo election](https://go.nvotes.com/booth/9/vote) with 2 questions, one for each of the possible layouts. All the questions are the same except for their layout.

### Normal

This is a simple layout. It shows a list of options that can be selected by clicking on them.

### Detailed Images

This layout enables displaying pictures. It is suitable for the voting system Plurality at large. This layout is not suitable for preferential voting sistems, so it shouldn't be used with Borda or Borda-nauru. This option is experimental  and it shouldn't be used without previously contacting with nVotes.

### Other

## Candidate options

Voting options, answers to a particular question in an election that can be chosen by the voter. You can reorder them and drop questions to reorder them. CLick in the question to add details filling the question fields.

Try it out! Here you can see a [voting booth demo](https://vota1.agoravoting.com/%23/election/516/vote). It is recommended to check the voting booth layout in a PC, mobile phones and with different combinations of browsers and screen resolutions (you can use tools like [resizemybrowser.com](http://resizemybrowser.com/)). Occasionally a voting booth might be easy to use in a 15 inch laptop but difficult to use in a smartphone. A good idea is to gather information on what devices, browsers and screen resolutions are used by the voters or the visitors of your webpage (this is normally easy to find using the analytics tool of your webpage).
